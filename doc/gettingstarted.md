The following short tutorial shows how to perform timing analysis on a simple C program. The tutorial assumes that all commands are executed in an terminal that shows `[MCB32]` before the command prompt, and that the `kta` command is compiled and accessible. If not, please follow the installation instructions [available here](../README.md).

## Display KTA commands

You can show the list of available KTA commands by simply typing 

	>>kta
	
To get help for a command, write `kta help` followed by the command. For instance,

	>>kta help exec
	
will display all options that can be used together with the command `exec`, which performs concrete execution of a function.
