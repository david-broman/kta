- How to pretty print addresses for conditional jumps? Hex?
- How to print the offset for indirect jumps?

NOT-YET-IMPLEMENTED
====================
- Floating-point instructions are not yet implemented. Some draft code are available 
  in file floating.ml. 
- The bitcoder blob is not implemented. Have no good test cases.

TO TEST 
=================
- Misc memory instructions and system instructions are implemented but there
   are no unit tests.
-


TO Implement
=================
- Implement uint module.
- General impl for icmp 
- Impl. all conversion operations
- Rewrite to new standard for jalr
- Add translation function to i32.
- Check that mul 2 becomes shl
- Optimization: Compare with intermediate should use SLTI and SLTIU for small integers.
- Add peephole optimization after code generation. 
   - Remove unnecessary moves
   - Redundant computations (different variables assigned the same value)

//Generated the select instruction
int comp2(int x, int y, int z){
  int a = x > 4 ? y : z;
  return a;
}
