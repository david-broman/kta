Comment:
- It is unclear if new abbreviations can be added to a block if already a
BLOCKINFO block has defined abbreviations. If so, should the abbreviation number be increased?

- The blob (code 5) in DEFINE_ABBREV do not say what vbr6 stands for. I assume it is the
  length of the blob, but it should be stated explicitly.

- In ENTER_SUBBLOCK it is unclear what blocklen means. It should be made clear by an
  example that it does not include the Enter_subblock data.

- The LLVM IR Blocks are incorrect. Compare with file include/llvm/Bitcode/LLVMBitCodes.h

- A bug in the documentation that took long time to find. In section
  DEFINE_ABBREV Encoding. It is not clear that the literal operand
  should not be emitted in the real string. To clarify this, it would
  be good to state this explicitly and also to have a small example
  show this (same way as was done with arrays.)

- It is unclear how the bitcode file ends. When looking at many files, it seems that there
  are some trailing bytes.
